This repository is a small collection of example go programs that serve as a backup for me to refer to if/when I need a reminder about some pattern or syntax. If it helps someone else in the process, that would be an unintended but definitely a pleasant surprise. :smile:

To try any example in this repository, run it from the root of the repo. For example:
```shell
$ go run ./syncOnce/once.go
```
